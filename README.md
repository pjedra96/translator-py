# translator-py

A translator desktop app fully developed in Python. The graphical interface is build completely on top of the tkinter library, with translating and sound-related libraries also being used. The program currently allows for speech-to-text translation (through microphone), and includes text-to-speech of the input from both text boxes individually. The TTS voice is wholly dependent on the language selected.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (https://www.github.com/pjedra96/translator-py) to a directory of your choice.
2. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your device (ideally version 3.7.9 for optimal results).
3. It is likely that you may not have all the required libraries installed. It is recommended to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the files listed in the requirements.txt file.
4. Navigate to the main folder, where `trsnalator.py` is and either double click it to run, or navigate to the folder in the CMD/terminal and execute the following command `python translator.py`.
